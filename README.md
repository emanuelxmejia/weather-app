# Weather app by Emanuel Mejia

A simple weather app using an API from [Open Weather App](https://openweathermap.org/).

The app gets your current location, if you denied your location is gonna show you a default city and its weather.

The data is gonna save it into local storage.

Also you can toggle between a very simple dark theme or light theme.

I used **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **WebPack** and **Babel**
